# Runs one tier1 part inside a BSD virtual machine, against the bundles a
# cross build uploaded, from the root of the workspace the VM was handed.
# test-bsd.yml boots the machine; this is what it runs there, the same on
# every BSD but for what each one needs of a JDK it did not build itself.
#
# Usage: bsd-tier1-in-vm.sh <test-suite>
#
# It returns 0 when the tests ran, whatever they found: the VM actions copy
# the workspace back out only when their step succeeds, so a failing exit
# here would throw away the files the failure has to be read from.
# test-bsd.yml reads make's verdict on the runner afterwards.
